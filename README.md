# treatments-analysis
####The attached file contains data from 3 treatment groups with 2 types of measured parameters, one measured over time.
•	In the same file, evaluate the data in tabular form by providing: group mean, SD and SEM.
•	Perform the corresponding statistical comparison of groups by time and treatment for both parameters.
•	Prepare 2 plots, a bar graph for the infarct size parameter and a scatter plot for the ST parameter, connected by a straight line. In both graphs, indicate the SEMs, if any, with significance signs at the appropriate locations. Put the plots into a PowerPoint file, label the slides and summarise the content in one sentence
